# **DevOps AI Prompt Library**

A curated collection of AI prompts designed specifically for DevOps engineers, SREs, and Cloud practitioners to accelerate routine tasks.

This library acts as a DevOps Copilot Playbook, helping you troubleshoot faster, automate smarter, and adopt best practices consistently using structured AI prompts.

## üìñ **What is this?**

DevOps engineers often spend time repeating the same tasks:

* Debugging Kubernetes manifests
* Fixing Terraform configs
* Resolving CI/CD pipeline errors
* Investigating incidents
* Optimizing cloud costs

Instead of writing ad-hoc AI queries each time, this project provides ready-to-use prompt templates you can copy, fill in, and run with your AI assistant.

Think of it as your personal AI prompt cheat sheet for DevOps.

## ‚ú® **Features**

* 20+ production-ready prompts
* Covers Infrastructure, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Ops/Monitoring/Security
* Structured with context, role, and task sections
* Optimized for clarity, reproducibility, and real-world debugging
* Markdown-based ‚Üí easy to copy-paste into ChatGPT, Claude, or other LLMs
